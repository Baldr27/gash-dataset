Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.\n#    For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials\n#\n# 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.\n#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret\n#\n# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME.
